## mgmt - a minimal, cross-platform, unix-like-system management program
The title says a lot really. This program is designed to detect which programs
are affiliated with the unix-like system, whether it be Debian or macOS. There
are various shortcuts to common unix-like commands, such as update and upgrade
(for package managers), another is poweroff or reboot. So far it is still
heavily under development

#### examples
mm update -- updates all installed package manager's repositories

mm upgrade -- upgrades all installed package manager's packages
